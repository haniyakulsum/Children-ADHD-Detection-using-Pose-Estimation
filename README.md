# Children-ADHD-Detection-using-Pose-Estimation
Non-invasive ADHD detection system for children using pose estimation and machine learning to analyze movement patterns from video tasks, achieving 89% accuracy with Random Forest.

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project uses **pose estimation** and **machine learning** to develop a non-invasive ADHD detection system for children.  
It analyzes movement patterns from video recordings of structured tasks to identify behavioral markers associated with ADHD, such as increased movement frequency, postural instability, and impulsivity.
